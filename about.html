        <p>
            Hello there! I'm a multi-faceted individual, and I find immense joy in weaving together diverse passions
            that define the symphony of my life.
            <br><br>

            I've been into music from an early age, finding a lasting connection with the piano.
            From childhood tunes to performing in concert halls worldwide, music has been a constant in my life.
            Recently, I've developed a deep appreciation for cooking. It's not just a hobby; it's an adventure.
            In the kitchen I enjoy experimenting with flavors and techniques to
            create something uniquely delightful that I can share with others.
            <br><br>

            In the realm of engineering, I take on the role of a leader and board member at my school's Engineering
            Without Borders chapter. This engagement empowers me to apply engineering skills to real-world challenges,
            aligning with my commitment to contribute positively to society. As a member of the Theta Tau engineering
            fraternity, I've not only found a community but also cultivated essential qualities that extend beyond academic
            pursuits.
            <br><br>

            Coding and engineering serve as my creative playgrounds, where I explore the art of problem-solving.
            There's an unparalleled thrill in crafting something entirely new, whether it's a sleek piece of code or a
            sophisticated engineering solution. The satisfaction that comes from overcoming complex challenges is like a
            burst of energy that fuels my passion for what I do.
            <br><br>

            Dedicated to a journey of perpetual learning, I wholeheartedly embrace opportunities for growth as my career
            unfolds. The dynamic nature of technology and engineering presents an ever-evolving landscape, and I'm committed
            to staying on the cutting edge, expanding my skill set, and diving into new challenges headfirst. This dedication
            isn't just a professional pursuit—it's a personal commitment to cultivating a mindset of curiosity and
            adaptability, ensuring that I'm always ready for the next exciting chapter in my career.
            <br><br>

            Currently, I'm immersed in a compelling project at UCSB, where we explore the intersection of coding and
            neuroscience. Our focus is on using neural networks to recreate fMRI data from the NSD dataset—an exciting
            venture that combines my love for technology with an interest in understanding the intricacies of the human brain.
            <br><br>

            Whether you want to chat about music, share your favorite recipe, dive into engineering discussions, or just
            shoot the breeze, I'm all ears. Don't hesitate to reach out—I'm looking forward to connecting!
